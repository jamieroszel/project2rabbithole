# Organization
## controllers
* Controller functions get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user to view in the browser.
* functions that separate out the code to route requests from the code that actually processes requests.
# db
## models
* this folder will contain the models that will be used to create documents, based on the schema, using mongoose and mongodb.
## public
the public folder serves static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
## routes
* URL-handling code
* A route is a section of Express code that associates an HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), a URL path/pattern, and a function that is called to handle that pattern.
* Routes forward the supported requests (and any information encoded in request URLs) to the appropriate controller functions.
## views
* the views folder holds the HTML that will be returned to the client URL request
* this will be an HTML template that also uses ejs to dynamically render pages for the user
## Middleware
* Morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
* Cors: CORS allows you to configure the web API's security. It has to do with allowing other domains to make requests against your web API.
* method-override: Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesnâ€™t support it.
